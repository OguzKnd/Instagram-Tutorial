# Instagram-Tutorial

In this Instagram Tutorial project, I utilized the MVVM architecture pattern within the SwiftUI framework. I implemented the main features of Instagram, such as the home feed, profile page, and search page. To handle data storage and retrieval, I integrated the Firebase library and utilize Firestore databases. Additionally, I leveraged Firebase Auth, Storage, and Database to handle authentication, file storage, and other database operations.

For the user interface, you utilize features like ScrollView, TabBar, and NavigationView to structure and design the different pages. Furthermore, I implemented user authentication using the Email/Password method, ensuring that each user has a separate account within the Authentication database.
